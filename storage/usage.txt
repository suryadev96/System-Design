curl localhost:3001/memory/foo --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"data":"This is some data in memory"}'

curl localhost:3001/memory/foo -w "\n"

create directory aedb_data

curl localhost:3001/disk/foo --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"data":"This is some data in disk"}'

curl localhost:3001/disk/foo -w "\n"
